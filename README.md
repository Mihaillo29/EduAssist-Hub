# EduAssist Hub (Work in Progress Check The Demo Below)

EduAssist Hub is a comprehensive educational platform that leverages cutting-edge technologies like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) to streamline the learning experience for students. Designed for exam preparation and active learning, the platform simplifies interactions with study materials, quizzes, and videos.

## Key Features

### 1. StudyEase
StudyEase offers seamless PDF navigation, allowing students to query their PDF content directly. No more back-and-forth between screensâ€”ask questions, get answers, and focus on what matters.

### 4. RAG Agent for Video Learning
The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agent allows students to interact with videos by querying the content. This feature promotes interactive learning by enabling students to ask questions while watching educational videos, deepening comprehension.

## Work in Progress ðŸš§

I am are continuously improving EduAssist Hub to provide an even more enhanced learning experience. Here's what I'm are currently working on:

- **RAG Agent Video Chat**: Expanding the RAG agent functionality to allow for dynamic question-answer interaction directly with videos. Students will be able to ask questions while watching the video, and the system will respond in real-time.
  
- **Real-time Text Extraction from Videos**: We are developing a feature to extract and display text content inside videos in real-time. This will further assist students in getting immediate feedback from video learning materials.

Stay tuned for more updates and features!
